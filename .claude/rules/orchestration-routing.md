## Builder Spec Gate

For tasks expected to modify 3+ files, the builder agent should write a brief implementation spec to STATE.md (`## Current Task Spec`) before writing code:
- Target files and expected changes
- Approach in 2-3 sentences
- Edge cases to handle

This prevents wasted context on false starts and helps reviewers understand intent.

---

## Recommended Workflow

The standard project lifecycle follows this sequence:

```
/capture-idea → /run-project (planning) → /run-project (execution cycles) → /save → /doctor
```

| Phase | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Idea capture | `/capture-idea` | Record the idea and emit IDEA_CAPTURED event |
| Planning | `/run-project` | Process event, generate PRD, create task queue |
| Execution | `/run-project` | Execute tasks from the queue (repeat as needed) |
| Session compression | `/save` | Persist all progress to files for session continuity |
| Verification | `/doctor` | Validate system integrity and file consistency |

> Run `/save` before ending any session with in-progress work.
> Run `/doctor` after major milestones or before sharing the project.

---

## Fallback Rule

If a task type is not listed above:
1. Assign to **Orchestrator** as primary.
2. Log a warning in the execution summary: `"No routing rule for task type: <type>"`.
3. Proceed with best-effort execution.

---

## Friction Awareness Rule

**Before executing any task** that produces user-facing output, the executing agent must:

1. Reference the Friction Audit Checklist at `.claude/skills/friction-audit/CHECKLIST.md`
2. Apply the relevant checks to their output
3. Log friction findings in the Execution Summary: `Friction check: [passed | N items flagged]`

A task is considered **user-facing** if its description contains any of these keywords: `UI`, `page`, `screen`, `form`, `onboarding`, `landing`, `signup`, `login`, `checkout`, `dashboard`, `settings`, `profile`, `navigation`, `menu`.

This keyword-based approach works regardless of whether the skill has been assigned yet.

## How to Add a New Route

1. Define the new agent in `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`.
2. Add a row to the table above with the task type, primary agent, and review agent(s).
3. Run `/fix-registry` to ensure the REGISTRY is up to date.
