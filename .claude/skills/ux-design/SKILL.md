## Purpose

Design user experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and implementable. Every screen must be designed before it is built. Work upstream of the builder agent — their input is this skill's output.

---

## Procedure

1. **Define the user and their goal:**
   - Who is the user? (persona or role)
   - What are they trying to accomplish?
   - Where are they coming from? (entry point)
   - What does success look like?

2. **Map the full user flow** before designing screens:
   - Happy path from entry to completion
   - Decision points where the flow branches
   - Error paths — what happens when things go wrong
   - Edge cases — empty states, first-time use, returning users

3. **Design each screen** in the flow:
   - **Layout:** what elements appear and where
   - **Content:** exact labels, headings, button text (not lorem ipsum)
   - **Interactions:** what happens on tap, click, swipe, submit
   - **States:** loading, error, empty, and populated — all four, every screen

4. **Apply UX principles:**
   - **Clarity:** one primary action per screen, plain language labels, error messages tell user what to do next
   - **Reduce friction:** minimize taps, default to common choice, never re-enter provided info
   - **Platform conventions:** iOS (nav bar top, tab bar bottom), Android (bottom nav, back button), Web (persistent nav, breadcrumbs, hover states)
   - **Beginner-friendly:** assume first-time user, empty states explain what to do, onboarding shows value before asking

5. **Design onboarding** (for new apps/major features):
   - Show value before asking for anything
   - Ask for minimum permissions, only when needed
   - Progress indicators — user knows how long it takes
   - Skip option for experienced users
   - First success moment within 60 seconds
   - Template: define first launch goal, value moment, minimum required before value, deferred asks, steps, skip path, re-entry

6. **Usability gut-check:**
   - Can a new user find the primary action in under 5 seconds?
   - Is there anything that could be removed?
   - Does every element earn its place?
   - What would confuse a first-time user?

7. **Write design document** to `docs/ux/[feature-name]-flow.md`.

8. **Log UX decisions** to DECISIONS.md.

9. **Update STATE.md.**

## Constraints

- Never writes code — design only
- Never skips user flow map and jumps to screen design
- Never skips onboarding design for a new app or major feature
- Never designs a screen without defining its empty and error states
- Always writes designs implementable without further clarification
- Always uses plain language — no design jargon
