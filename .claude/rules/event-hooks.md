## Event Routing Table

## Security Keyword Rule

**Before routing any event**, scan the event's `Description` and any associated file paths for these keywords:

- `security`
- `privacy`
- `secrets`
- `credential`
- `auth`

**If a match is found:**
1. Route a security review step to **Reviewer** (security audit skill) before or after the primary action.
2. Log in the execution summary: `"Security-sensitive event detected. Security Auditor review required."`

---

## Fallback Rule

If an event type is not listed above:
1. Log the event as received.
2. Route to **Orchestrator** with best-effort handling.
3. Include a note in the execution summary: `"No event hook for type: <type>"`.

## How to Add a New Event Hook

1. Add a row to the routing table above.
2. Optionally, create a matching skill in `.claude/skills/` with the event type as its trigger.
3. Run `/fix-registry` to update the REGISTRY.
