# CLAUDE.md — The AI Orchestrator System Context Index

> This file is loaded automatically on every session. Keep it concise.

## Project Identity

- **Template:** The AI Orchestrator System
- **Problem:** The Syntax Wall (you can architect and direct — but writing code line-by-line blocks shipping)
- **Method:** AI Orchestration Framework (agents, skills, hooks, and state machine for structured AI development)
- **Tool:** The AI Orchestrator System (this template — software development variant)

## Context Loading Policy

To stay token-efficient, load context incrementally:

| Situation | Load |
|-----------|------|
| **Default (any task)** | This file + relevant rules for the task type |
| **Conceptual / design work** | + `DECISIONS.md` + `GLOSSARY.md` |
| **Research-backed claims** | + `RESEARCH.md` |
| **Uncertainty or ambiguity** | + `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` |
| **Running the system** | + `STATE.md` + `EVENTS.md` + `REGISTRY.md` |
| **Session start** | Scan `AI-Memory/lessons/` for entries relevant to the current task |
| **Session start** | Load `~/.ai-orchestrator/user-profile.md` if it exists (adapts output style, experience level, role) |

> Do NOT load all files at once. Read only what the current task requires.

## Conventions

- STATE.md is the single source of truth for current work.
- Every action must update STATE before completing.
- Events are processed oldest-first (FIFO).
- Default mode is Semi-Autonomous: one unit of work, then stop.
- When the user asks a framework question, requests guidance, or describes a goal without specifying a command, follow the coach agent procedure at `.claude/agents/coach.md`.
- For first-time orientation, run `/start` first; the coach handles follow-up conversation.
