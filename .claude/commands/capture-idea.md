# Command: /capture-idea

> Capture a project idea and seed the system. Behavior adapts to Framework Mode:
> - **Full Planning mode:** Full intake → PRD stub → architecture stub → tasks → event
> - **Quick Start mode:** Quick conversation → immediate scaffold tasks → event

---

## Procedure

### Step 0: Check Framework Mode

Read `.claude/project/STATE.md` § `## Framework Mode`.

- If `Quick Start`: follow the **Quick Start Path** below.
- If `Full Planning` (or not set): follow the **Full Planning Path** (default, Steps 1-6).

---

# Quick Start Path

> Goal: Get a working app scaffold in the first `/run-project` cycle. Planning docs come later.

### B1: Quick Conversation (5 minutes max)

Ask only these 3 questions:

```
What are you making? (e.g., "a to-do app", "a recipe website", "a mobile game", "a game")
What's it called?
What's the #1 thing it needs to do?
```

Accept freeform answers. Do not enforce templates. If the user provides more detail, great — extract it. If they give one sentence, that's enough.

### B2: Create Minimal Docs

Create `docs/PRD.md` (only if it doesn't exist) with a minimal stub:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

> [One sentence: what it does]

## Core Feature
- [The #1 thing from B1]

## Notes
*(This doc grows as you build. Don't worry about making it perfect now.)*
```

Create `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` with just the name and one-liner (if it doesn't exist).

### B3: Seed Scaffold Tasks

Write to STATE.md Next Task Queue (if empty/placeholder).

**Game Detection:** If the answer to "What are you making?" matches game keywords (game, video game, board game, card game, mobile game, platformer, RPG, FPS, strategy, roguelike, puzzle game, shooter, racing, simulation, fighting, adventure, sandbox, tower defense, survival, horror game, visual novel), use the **game task set**. For ambiguous cases ("gamified app", "interactive experience"), ask: "Is this primarily a game, or an app with game elements?" Default to standard tasks if unclear.

**Standard tasks (non-game):**

| # | Task | Priority | Skill |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Create initial app scaffold (src/) | High | — |
| 2 | Build [core feature from B1] | High | — |
| 3 | Add basic styling and layout | Medium | SKL-0005 |

**Game tasks:**

| # | Task | Priority | Skill |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Create initial game scaffold (src/) | High | — |
| 2 | Build [core mechanic from B1] | High | — |
| 3 | Add basic game loop and input handling | Medium | — |

The Skill column uses `—` for scaffold tasks because the specific skill depends on the project type (web, mobile, game, etc.) — the orchestrator's auto-classification will handle it.

### B4: Emit Events

Emit `IDEA_CAPTURED` event (same as Full Planning path Step 5).

Then emit a second event for the problem stress test:

```
EVT-XXXX | PROBLEM_VALIDATION_REQUESTED | Problem stress test for <project name> | system | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

Auto-increment the EVT ID from the event emitted above. This triggers SKL-0027 (Problem Stress Test) during the next `/run-project` cycle.

If the project was detected as a game (same keyword detection as in B3), also emit:

```
EVT-XXXX | GDD_CREATION_REQUESTED | Game design document for <project name> | system | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

This triggers SKL-0028 (GDD Writing) during the next `/run-project` cycle.

### B5: Print Summary

```
Your idea is captured! Run `/run-project` to start building.

What happens next:
- The system will create your app's basic structure
- Then it will build your core feature: [#1 thing from B1]
- You can add more features anytime by describing what you want

Tip: You can switch to Full Planning mode anytime with `/set-mode full-planning`
if you want more detailed planning.
```

---

# Full Planning Path

> Full planning pipeline. This is the original `/capture-idea` behavior.

### Step 1: Collect the Idea

Ask the user to fill in this template (5-15 lines). Accept freeform answers — do not enforce strict formatting:

```
NAME:
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING? (a website, a phone app, an API, a SaaS product, a game):
ONE-LINER:
WHO IT'S FOR:
THE PROBLEM:
WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
KEY FEATURES (bullets):
WHAT IT SHOULD NOT DO (bullets):
LIMITS (time, budget, what you know):
```

If the user provides a freeform description instead of the template, extract as many fields as possible and note any gaps.

### Step 2: Archive Raw Intake to Research

Append the user's raw input (verbatim) to `.claude/project/knowledge/RESEARCH.md` as a new entry.

**Format** (append-only — never overwrite existing entries):

```
---

### RES-XXXX: Idea Intake — <project name>

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Source:** User idea intake via /capture-idea
- **Summary:** <ONE-LINER from intake>
- **Relevance:** Foundational project concept. All planning derives from this intake.
- **Status:** Active

**Raw Intake:**

> <paste the user's full input verbatim, blockquoted>
```

Auto-increment the `RES-XXXX` ID from the highest existing ID in RESEARCH.md.

### Step 3: Create or Update Doc Stubs

For each file below, create it **only if it does not exist**. If the file already exists, **append** any missing sections (do not overwrite or duplicate existing sections).

#### docs/PRD.md

Populate these sections using the intake fields:

```
# Product Requirements Document

## Overview

<ONE-LINER expanded into 2-3 sentences using NAME, THE PROBLEM, and WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE>

## Target Users

<WHO IT'S FOR>

## Problem Statement

<THE PROBLEM>

## Goals

<WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE, rephrased as bullet points>

## Non-Goals

<WHAT IT SHOULD NOT DO bullets from intake>

## MVP Scope

<FEATURES bullets from intake>

## Risks and Assumptions

- Constraints: <LIMITS from intake>
- Assumptions: <any assumptions inferred from the intake>
- Risks: <any risks inferred from the intake>
```

#### docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

Populate these sections:

```
# Architecture

## Overview

Architecture details will be defined after the PRD is reviewed and approved.

## Initial Assumptions

- **Project Type:** <WHAT ARE YOU MAKING from intake>
- <any technical assumptions that can be inferred from the intake>

## Open Questions

See [.claude/project/knowledge/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](./.claude/project/knowledge/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) for unresolved technical questions.
```

### Step 3b: Create or Update Project Charter

If `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` does not exist, create it. If it exists, skip.

Populate from intake fields:

```
# Project Charter

## Project Name

<NAME from intake>

## Vision

<ONE-LINER from intake>

## Goals

<WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE from intake, as numbered list>

## Target Users

<WHO IT'S FOR from intake>

## Constraints

<LIMITS from intake, structured as Time/Budget/Technical/Knowledge>

## Success Criteria

<WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE from intake, rephrased as measurable outcomes>

## Non-Goals

<WHAT IT SHOULD NOT DO from intake>

## Risks

<Inferred from LIMITS and THE PROBLEM>
```

### Step 4: Seed Next Task Queue

Read `.claude/project/STATE.md` and locate the `## Next Task Queue` section.

**If the queue already contains real tasks**, do NOT modify it.
Print: `"Next Task Queue already populated; skipping seeding."`

A queue is considered **empty/placeholder-only** if it matches ANY of these patterns:
- Contains only `(none)` or `*(none)*`
- Contains only `- (none)`
- Contains only the table headers with no data rows beneath them
- The section is completely empty

**If the queue is empty or placeholder-only**, replace it with starter tasks.

**Game Detection:** Use the same game keyword detection as in B3 (Quick Start). Check the "WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?" field from the intake. If the project is a game, use the **game task set**. Otherwise, use the **standard task set**.

**Standard tasks (non-game):**

| # | Task | Priority | Skill |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Draft PRD v1 (docs/PRD.md) | High | SKL-0004 |
| 2 | Review PRD for beginner clarity | High | SKL-0016 |
| 3 | Draft Architecture v1 (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | High | — |
| 4 | Break PRD into tasks | Medium | SKL-0003 |
| 5 | Run first build scaffold | Medium | — |

**Game tasks:**

| # | Task | Priority | Skill |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Write Game Design Document (docs/GDD.md) | High | SKL-0028 |
| 2 | Review GDD for clarity and completeness | High | SKL-0016 |
| 3 | Draft Architecture v1 (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | High | — |
| 4 | Break GDD into tasks | Medium | SKL-0003 |
| 5 | Build initial game scaffold | Medium | — |

### Step 5: Emit Events

#### 5A: Emit IDEA_CAPTURED

Check `.claude/project/EVENTS.md` under `## Unprocessed Events`.

**Canonical event format** (must match the format defined in `.claude/project/EVENTS.md`):

```
EVT-XXXX | IDEA_CAPTURED | <project name> idea captured | user | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

- **If the most recent unprocessed event already matches** `IDEA_CAPTURED` with the same project name (compare the `IDEA_CAPTURED` type and that the description contains `<project name> idea captured`): skip emitting. Print: `"IDEA_CAPTURED event already pending; skipping."`
- **Otherwise:** append the canonical event line under `## Unprocessed Events`.
- Auto-increment the EVT ID from the highest existing ID across **both** Unprocessed and Processed sections.
- If the section currently shows `*(none)*`, replace the placeholder with the new event.

#### 5B: Emit PROBLEM_VALIDATION_REQUESTED

Immediately after the IDEA_CAPTURED event, emit a second event:

```
EVT-XXXX | PROBLEM_VALIDATION_REQUESTED | Problem stress test for <project name> | system | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

- Auto-increment the EVT ID from the event emitted in Step 5A.
- This triggers SKL-0027 (Problem Stress Test) during the next `/run-project` cycle.
- The stress test is **advisory** — it produces a challenge report but never blocks progression.

#### 5C: Emit GDD_CREATION_REQUESTED (game projects only)

If the project was detected as a game (same keyword detection as in B3/Step 4), emit a third event:

```
EVT-XXXX | GDD_CREATION_REQUESTED | Game design document for <project name> | system | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

- Auto-increment the EVT ID from the event emitted in Step 5B.
- This triggers SKL-0028 (GDD Writing) during the next `/run-project` cycle.
- For non-game projects, skip this step entirely.

### Step 6: Print Summary

Print a concise confirmation:

```
## Idea Captured

- **Project:** <NAME>
- **Files Created:** [list of new files]
- **Files Updated:** [list of files that were appended to]
- **Research Entry:** RES-XXXX
- **Tasks Queued:** [seeded (5) | skipped (already populated)]
- **Event Emitted:** [yes | skipped (already pending)]

### Next Task Queue

| # | Task | Priority | Skill |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... |
```

Then print the last 5 lines of `.claude/project/EVENTS.md`.
