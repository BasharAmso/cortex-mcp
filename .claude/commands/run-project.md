# Command: /run-project

> Execute one or more orchestration cycles, respecting the current mode and run policy. This is the main entry point for project execution.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Load State and Policy

Read `.claude/project/STATE.md` to determine:
- Current Mode (Safe / Semi-Autonomous / Autonomous)
- Active Task (if any is already in progress)
- Next Task Queue
- Run Cycle fields

Read `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md` to determine:
- Cycle limit for the current mode
- Stop conditions
- Review gates

Read `.claude/project/EVENTS.md` to check for unprocessed events.

**Auto-refresh REGISTRY if stale:** Before proceeding, check if `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md` is current:
1. Scan all subfolders in `.claude/skills/` for `SKILL.md` files.
2. If any skill folder exists that is **not listed** in the REGISTRY Skills Index table, or if REGISTRY.md contains `(none)` placeholders despite skill files existing, run the `/fix-registry` procedure inline.
3. Log: `"Registry auto-refreshed — X skills found."` (or skip silently if already current).

Initialize the run:
- Set Current Cycle = 0 in .claude/project/STATE.md Run Cycle section.
- Set Max Cycles This Run from the Cycle Limits table in RUN_POLICY.md for the current mode.
- Set Last Run Status = `Running`.
- Read Circuit Breaker thresholds from `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md` (Consecutive Failure Limit, Time Limit, Phantom Completion Limit, Compaction Interval).
- Read Parallel Execution settings from `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md` (Parallel Enabled, Max Parallel Slots, Merge Conflict Limit).
- Set `Consecutive Failures = 0`, `Phantom Completions = 0` in STATE.md Run Cycle section.
- If `Run Type` is not already set to `Overnight` (by `/overnight`), set `Run Type = Standard`.
- **Update Session Lock:** Set `Session Started` to current timestamp and `Checkpointed = No` in the Session Lock section of STATE.md (see orchestrator.md § "Initialization").

### Step 1.5: Check Mode Escalation

Read the Mode Escalation table in `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md`. If the current phase and mode match a suggestion row, print the suggestion once at the top of the run output. Then proceed normally — do not block or force a mode change.

### Step 2: Determine What to Process

**Priority order:**
1. If there is an **Active Task** with Status = `In Progress`: resume it.
2. If there are **unprocessed events**: select the oldest (FIFO).
3. If no events and `Parallel Enabled = Yes`: check if the Next Task Queue has 2+ independent tasks at the same priority level (see `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` § "Parallel Dispatch"). If yes, follow the parallel dispatch procedure instead of promoting a single task.
4. If no events and parallel not applicable: **promote the next task** from the Next Task Queue to Active Task (standard sequential flow).
5. If nothing to do: check `Current Phase` in STATE.md and print phase-appropriate guidance (see `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` § "Phase-Aware Guidance"). Use plain-language messages that tell the user exactly what command to run next — never leave them at a dead end. Stop after printing.

### Step 3: Route and Execute

Follow the Orchestrator's routing logic (see `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`):

1. Look up the event TYPE or task description in `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md` trigger column.
2. If a skill matches: execute that skill's procedure.
3. If no match: fall back to `.claude/rules/event-hooks.md`, then `.claude/rules/orchestration-routing.md`.
4. Execute the routed action.

### Step 4: Update State

After execution:
- Update Active Task fields in `.claude/project/STATE.md` (Status, Outputs Produced, Files Modified).
- If processing an event: move it from Unprocessed to Processed in `.claude/project/EVENTS.md`.
- If task is complete: move it to Completed Tasks Log and clear Active Task.
- Promote the next task if appropriate.

### Step 5: Execute Cycles

Follow the Autonomous Run Cycles procedure defined in `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Safe | Propose the next action but do NOT execute. Print what would happen. Stop after proposal. |
| Semi-Autonomous | Execute exactly **1 cycle** (one event or one task), then stop. |
| Autonomous | Execute up to the cycle limit defined in RUN_POLICY.md (default **10 cycles**), evaluating stop conditions between each. |

For each cycle:
1. **Snapshot STATE.md** before execution (see orchestrator.md § "Pre-Cycle Snapshot").
2. **Check for parallel dispatch:** If Step 2 identified parallel candidates, follow orchestrator.md § "Parallel Dispatch" instead of the single-task flow below. A parallel dispatch counts as one cycle.
3. Select → Route → Execute → Review → Update .claude/project/STATE.md → Increment Current Cycle → Print Execution Summary.
3. **On failure:** Restore STATE.md from snapshot, set task to Blocked, and stop. Print the rollback message.
4. Before starting the next cycle, evaluate all stop conditions from `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md`.
5. **Between cycles (Overnight/Autonomous hardening):** Follow the Between Cycles procedure in `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` — this includes inter-cycle commits, consecutive failure tracking, time limit checks, and auto-compaction.

### Step 6: Check Stop Conditions

Stop immediately if any condition from `.claude/project/RUN_POLICY.md` is met:
- The user says stop
- A task becomes Blocked
- A single file change exceeds 500 lines
- The queue is empty and no next tasks can be proposed
- A required artifact is missing and cannot be created safely
- The project goal exit condition is satisfied (if `GOAL.md` exists)
- Max Cycles This Run is reached
- Consecutive failure limit reached: if `Consecutive Failures` >= limit from RUN_POLICY.md, stop. Set Last Run Status = `"Stopped: [N] consecutive failures"`.
- Time limit exceeded (Overnight only): if elapsed time since `Session Started` > `Time Limit Hours`, stop. Set Last Run Status = `"Stopped: time limit ([duration])"`.
- Phantom completion limit reached (Overnight only): if `Phantom Completions` >= limit from RUN_POLICY.md, stop. Set Last Run Status = `"Stopped: [N] phantom completions"`.

Set Last Run Status in .claude/project/STATE.md accordingly.

### Step 6.5: Auto-Learning (Overnight Mode Only)

When the run ends AND `Run Type = Overnight` in STATE.md:

1. Read STATE.md: `Completed Tasks Log` (tasks completed during this run, filtered by timestamp >= Session Started) and `Failed Approaches` table.
2. Analyze patterns: which skills succeeded vs failed, common failure reasons, reusable insights.
3. Write lessons to AI-Memory automatically using the analysis procedure from `/learn` (Steps 1-2) — no user confirmation needed (unattended).
4. Log: `"Auto-learning: [N] lessons extracted and saved to AI-Memory."`

> Uses STATE.md data, not conversation history (which may be compacted during long runs).
> If no extractable patterns found: log `"Auto-learning: no notable patterns this run."`

### Output Policy

> **Goal:** Minimize chat context usage during multi-task runs. Write artifacts to files, not chat.

**1. Write artifacts to canonical files, never to chat.**

All substantial output (documents, plans, code, analysis) must be written to the appropriate repository file:

| Artifact Type | Destination |
|---------------|-------------|
| Documentation | `docs/` |
| Task status & progress | `.claude/project/STATE.md` |
| Event records | `.claude/project/EVENTS.md` |
| Decisions (architectural, product, design) | `.claude/project/knowledge/DECISIONS.md` |
| Research, glossary, open questions | `.claude/project/knowledge/` |
| Task definitions & breakdowns | `tasks/` |

**2. Never print full documents in chat.**

Do not echo file contents, full plans, full PRDs, or generated documents into the chat window. Write them to files and reference the file path.

**3. Chat output per cycle must contain ONLY:**

- Task completed (ID + one-line description)
- Files changed (list of paths)
- Decisions made (one-line each)
- Next task (ID + one-line description)

**4. Chat summaries must stay under 200 words** unless the user explicitly requests more detail.

**5. All architectural or product decisions must be persisted** to `.claude/project/knowledge/DECISIONS.md` using the entry template defined in that file.

**6. Project progress must always update:**

- `.claude/project/STATE.md` — active task, status, outputs, files modified
- `.claude/project/EVENTS.md` — event processing status

### Step 7: Print Final Run Summary
