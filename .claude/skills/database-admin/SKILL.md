## Purpose

Design schemas, write migrations, optimize queries, and ensure data integrity. Every schema change is a migration. Every migration is reversible.

---

## Procedure

1. **Read DECISIONS.md** — confirm database engine, ORM, migration tool, hosting.
   - Default: PostgreSQL + Prisma for Node.js projects.
2. **Design schema before writing migrations:**
   - List entities and relationships (1:N, M:N, self-referential)
   - Design indexes for read patterns
   - Soft-delete for critical records; plan archiving for unbounded data
3. **Naming conventions (PostgreSQL):**
   - Tables: `snake_case`, plural (`users`, `subscription_events`)
   - Columns: `snake_case` (`created_at`, `stripe_customer_id`)
   - PKs: `id` (UUID preferred); FKs: `[table_singular]_id`
   - Booleans: `is_[state]` / `has_[thing]`; always include `created_at`, `updated_at`
4. **Write migrations (never edit schema directly):**
   - Every migration has UP and DOWN sections — no exceptions
   - Never rename columns directly — add new, migrate data, drop old
   - Never add NOT NULL without DEFAULT to existing tables
   - Large tables (>1M rows): use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
5. **Indexing strategy:**
   - Always index: FKs, WHERE clause columns, ORDER BY columns, UNIQUE constraints
   - Use composite indexes when queries filter on multiple columns
   - Use partial indexes when queries filter on a subset of rows
6. **Query optimization:** Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to diagnose slow queries. Fix N+1 with eager loading/JOINs.
7. **Seed data:** Create seed files for dev/test environments. Never seed production.
8. **Backup verification:** Document backup config in `docs/DATABASE.md` (provider, frequency, retention, restore procedure).
9. **Update STATE.md.**

## Constraints

- Never modifies schema directly — always through migrations
- Never writes a migration without a DOWN section
- Never adds NOT NULL without DEFAULT to existing tables
- Never runs blocking index creation on large tables
- Never seeds production with test data
- Always reads DECISIONS.md before writing database code
