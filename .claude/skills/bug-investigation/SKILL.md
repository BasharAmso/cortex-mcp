## Purpose

Systematically isolate and fix bugs. Hypothesis first, evidence second, fix third. Never guess — find the root cause, not just the symptom.

---

## Procedure

1. **Reproduce the bug** before touching any code.
   - Can it be reproduced consistently? What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible: log as intermittent and request more info.
2. **Form a hypothesis** about the root cause:
   - Check STATE.md for recent changes that may have introduced it
   - State explicitly: "I believe the bug is caused by X because Y."
3. **Gather evidence** to confirm or reject:
   - Read relevant code carefully
   - Trace execution path from input to failure
   - Check: off-by-one errors, null handling, async timing, data shape assumptions
4. **Confirm root cause before fixing.** If the fix isn't obvious, the root cause hasn't been found.
5. **Apply the minimal fix:**
   - Fix only what is broken — do not refactor surrounding code
   - If larger change needed: note it and add a refactor task instead
6. **Verify the fix:**
   - Does it resolve the bug? Does it break anything else?
   - If tests exist: do they pass?
7. **Document in STATE.md Completed Tasks Log:**
   - Root cause: [what caused it]
   - Fix applied: [what changed and why]
8. **Update STATE.md.**

## Constraints

- Never refactors while fixing a bug — separate tasks
- Never applies a fix without confirming root cause
- Never silently swallows errors
