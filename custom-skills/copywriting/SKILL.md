## Purpose

Write copy that converts — not just fills space. Generic placeholder text ("Welcome to our app") kills conversion rates. This skill applies proven copywriting frameworks to produce headlines, CTAs, landing page sections, email sequences, and micro-copy that matches the product's value proposition and target audience.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Understand the Context

Read:
1. `docs/PRD.md` — extract value proposition, target users, problem statement
2. Target page/component — understand what copy is needed and where
3. Any existing brand guidelines in `docs/`
4. `docs/PROBLEM_STRESS_TEST.md` (if exists) — the validated problem language

Identify the copy type needed:
- **Hero section** (headline + subhead + CTA)
- **Feature descriptions** (benefit-focused, not feature-focused)
- **Social proof** (testimonial framing, trust signals)
- **Email sequence** (welcome, onboarding, re-engagement)
- **Micro-copy** (button text, error messages, empty states, tooltips)
- **About page** (story, mission, team)

### Step 2 — Select Framework

| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **AIDA** | Landing pages, ads | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action |
| **PAS** | Problem-aware audiences | Problem → Agitate → Solution |
| **BAB** | Aspirational products | Before → After → Bridge |
| **4Ps** | Feature sections | Promise → Picture → Proof → Push |
| **StoryBrand** | Brand narrative | Character → Problem → Guide → Plan → Action → Success → Failure |

### Step 3 — Write Copy

**Headlines:**
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature
- Use the user's language (from PRD target users section)
- Test: "Would I click this?" If not, rewrite.
- Provide 3 headline options: safe, bold, and provocative

**CTAs:**
- Action verb + value ("Start saving time" not "Submit")
- One primary CTA per section — never compete with yourself
- Micro-copy under buttons reduces friction ("No credit card required", "Cancel anytime")

**Body copy:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Conversational tone unless brand guidelines specify otherwise
- Features → Benefits: "AI-powered search" → "Find what you need in seconds"

**Micro-copy:**
- Error messages: Say what went wrong + how to fix it
- Empty states: Guide the user to their first action
- Loading states: Reassure ("Setting up your workspace...")
- Success states: Celebrate + suggest next step

### Step 4 — Voice Consistency Check

If brand guidelines exist, verify all copy matches:
- Tone (formal/casual/playful/authoritative)
- Vocabulary level (target 8th-grade reading level for public content per accessibility rules)
- Prohibited words or phrases
- Pronoun style (we/you/our)

### Step 5 — Write Output

- If copy is for specific pages/components: write directly to those files
- If copy is general (email sequences, ad variations): write to `docs/COPY.md`
- Always provide the framework used and rationale for key choices

### Step 6 — Update STATE.md

---

## Constraints

- Never writes generic placeholder text — every string should be intentional
- Always leads with benefits, not features
- Copy must be factual — no unsupported claims or fake testimonials
- Respects accessibility: plain language, clear CTAs, no "click here"
- Does not make promises the product can't keep
- Multiple options provided for headlines and CTAs — user chooses
