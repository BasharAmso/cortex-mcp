## Purpose

Improve internal structure of working code without changing behavior. Behavior before and after: identical. Structure before and after: better.

---

## Procedure

1. **Check for existing tests** before refactoring:
   - Tests exist: confirm they pass before starting
   - No tests: warn user that refactoring without tests carries risk; request confirmation
2. **Define refactor scope narrowly:**
   - What specific improvement?
   - What is out of scope?
   - Will any public interface change? If yes: stop — that's a breaking change, not a refactor
3. **Refactor in small steps** — one improvement at a time:
   - Extract repeated code into functions
   - Rename for clarity
   - Break large functions into smaller ones
   - Remove dead code
   - Simplify conditionals
   - Consolidate duplicated logic
4. **Verify behavior unchanged** after each step:
   - Run existing tests; if they fail, revert and investigate
   - If no tests: manually verify affected behavior
5. **Update STATE.md.**

---

## Constraints

- Never changes behavior — only structure
- Never changes public APIs or interfaces
- Always works in small verifiable steps
- Always warns user when no tests exist

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Test status checked before starting
- [ ] Refactor scope defined and limited
- [ ] No public interfaces changed
- [ ] All tests pass after refactoring (or behavior manually verified)
- [ ] STATE.md updated
