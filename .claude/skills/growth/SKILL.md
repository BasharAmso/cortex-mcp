## Purpose

Build growth infrastructure — landing pages, SEO, referral mechanics, waitlists, social sharing. Growth is infrastructure that compounds, not a campaign.

---

## Procedure

1. **Extract value proposition from PRD:**
   - Who (target user), what problem, what product does, why now
   - Formula: "[Product] helps [user] [do X] so they can [outcome], without [pain]."
2. **Landing page structure** (high-converting order):
   1. Hero — who + what + primary CTA (above fold)
   2. Problem — amplify pain, make reader feel understood
   3. Solution — how product solves it (show, don't tell)
   4. Social proof — quotes, logos, numbers
   5. Features — 3 key capabilities with user benefits
   6. FAQ — top 5 objections answered
   7. Final CTA — same as hero
3. **SEO foundations:**
   - SEO component on all public pages (title, description, OG tags, Twitter card, structured data)
   - `robots.txt` (allow public, disallow /api/ and /dashboard/)
   - `sitemap.xml` auto-generated from pages
4. **Waitlist / email capture:**
   - Validate email, check duplicates, generate referral code
   - Send confirmation email with position and referral link
   - Track `waitlist_joined` event
5. **Referral mechanics (if PRD calls for it):**
   - Reward both referrer and referee
   - Reward referrer on activation (not signup) to prevent gaming
6. **Social sharing** — native share sheet on mobile, clipboard fallback, direct platform links.
7. **Update STATE.md.**

## Constraints

- Never writes dishonest or misleading marketing copy
- Never uses dark patterns (fake urgency, hidden costs)
- Never blocks signup with excessive fields — email first
- Never ships landing page without SEO metadata
- Always ties growth features to a PRD metric
- **Friction check before shipping:** Is CTA above fold? Can a visitor understand the product in under 10 seconds? Are form fields minimized? Reference: `.claude/skills/friction-audit/CHECKLIST.md`
