## Purpose

Find security vulnerabilities before they reach production. OWASP Top 10 scan, secrets detection, dependency audit, and auth review. Read-only analysis — never modifies source files.

> **See also:** For config-level defaults and hardcoded credentials, see SKL-0029 (Insecure Defaults). For security review of code diffs, see SKL-0030 (Differential Security Review). For dependency health and trust signals, see SKL-0031 (Supply Chain Audit).

## Procedure

1. **OWASP Top 10 scan** of target files:
   - Injection (SQL, command, template)
   - Broken auth (weak passwords, session issues, missing MFA)
   - Sensitive data exposure (unencrypted PII, logged secrets, verbose errors)
   - XSS/XXE (unsanitized input in HTML/XML/templates)
   - Broken access control (missing authz checks, privilege escalation)
   - Security misconfiguration (debug mode in prod, default credentials)
   - CSRF (missing tokens on state-changing operations)
2. **Secrets scan** across codebase:
   - API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys, connection strings
   - `.env` files committed to version control
   - Pattern matching for common secret formats (AWS keys, JWT secrets)
3. **Dependency audit** (if manifests exist):
   - Check for known CVEs
   - Flag outdated packages with vulnerabilities
   - Recommend patched versions
4. **Auth and authorization review:**
   - Tokens validated on every protected route?
   - Passwords hashed with strong algorithm (bcrypt, argon2)?
   - Session management secure (httpOnly, secure flags, expiry)?
   - Principle of least privilege followed?
5. **Produce security report** with severity ratings:
   - **CRITICAL:** Exploitable now, blocks deployment
   - **HIGH:** Serious risk, fix before merge
   - **MEDIUM:** Should fix, track in task queue
   - **LOW:** Best practice improvement
6. **Update STATE.md** with findings.

## Constraints

- Never modifies source files — read-only analysis
- Never logs, echoes, or exposes secrets — even in reports
- Never suggests disabling security features without justification
- Always recommends well-maintained libraries over custom crypto/auth
