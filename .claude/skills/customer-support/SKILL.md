# Skill: Customer Support Infrastructure

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Skill ID** | SKL-0014 |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Owner** | builder |
| **Inputs** | Task description, PRD, DECISIONS.md, existing UI components |
| **Outputs** | Onboarding, empty states, error messages, emails, help content, STATE.md updated |
| **Triggers** | `SUPPORT_FEATURE_REQUESTED` |

---

## Purpose

Build infrastructure that makes customers successful before they need help. Good onboarding, clear empty states, actionable error messages, and self-serve support content.

---

## Support Gap Matrix

| Gap | Solution |
|-----|---------|
| New user doesn't know where to start | Onboarding flow |
| Feature exists but undiscovered | Tooltips + feature discovery |
| Errors are cryptic | Actionable error messages |
| Empty states give no guidance | Empty state redesign |
| Users need async help | Help center / FAQ |
| Need to measure satisfaction | NPS / CSAT survey |

---

## Procedure

1. **Identify the support gap** from PRD and recent STATE.md completions.
2. **Onboarding flow:**
   - 3-5 steps maximum; first step completable in under 2 minutes
   - Each step shows clear value (not admin tasks)
   - Auto-complete steps when user does the action
   - Show progress indicator
3. **Empty states:** Every list/table/dashboard that can be empty needs title, description, and action button. No blank screens.
4. **Error messages:** Replace generic errors with actionable ones:
   - Say what happened, why (if known), and what user can do
   - Never blame the user; for server errors, say team is notified
5. **Email sequence (minimum):**
   - Immediate: welcome + how to get started
   - Day 1 (if not activated): nudge with primary CTA
   - Day 7 (if activated): what to explore next
   - Trial ending: what they get with paid plan
6. **NPS/CSAT (if PRD requires):** Show survey 14+ days after signup, only to activated users. Route detractors (0-6) to personal outreach, promoters (9-10) to review/referral ask.
7. **Help center (if needed):** Create `docs/help/` with getting-started, FAQ, per-feature docs, troubleshooting. Each article: steps (start with verbs), expected result, common problems.
8. **Update STATE.md.**

## Constraints

- Never ships a feature with blank empty states
- Never uses generic error messages — always actionable
- Never builds heavy support tooling before users exist
- Always writes onboarding around completing one meaningful action
- Never sends more than one email per day to a user
